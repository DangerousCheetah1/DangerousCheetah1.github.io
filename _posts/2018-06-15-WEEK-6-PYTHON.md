  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am still on the same lesson I as I was last week and I have been trying really quite hard for this one, but now I am starting to see that I may need to go over and revise the exercises as home as I just do not understand what I am actually doing now.</td>

**Evaluation of Learning This Lesson**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What went well: How did I learn? What helped me </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really went well this lesson, I was getting loads of things wrong and as soon as I sorted out one problem,  I managed to create another one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even better ifâ€¦: What could I do that would be even better? Improvements? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I genuinely just need to be able to understand what I am actually doing and how everything makes sense  and then once I have achieved that, I will be able to hopefully start flying through the exercises. I do know that they will get even harder but once I have completely understood all this base knowledge, then stuff will hopefully be easier for me. </td>
