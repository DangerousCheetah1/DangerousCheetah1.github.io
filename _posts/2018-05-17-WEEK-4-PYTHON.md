  </tr>
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even better ifâ€¦: What could I do that would be even better? Improvements? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It would have been great if I hadn't had to leave during the lesson, so if I was in the lesson I would have liked to understand the code better in order to complete the lesson and be satisfied. </td>
  </tr>
