**Evaluation of Learning This Lesson**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What went well: How did I learn? What helped me </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ozzy and I worked well together and got three whole exercises done as both of us were communicating and we were both trying different things and using each other's mistakes as guidelines for each of our own code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even better if…: What could I do that would be even better? Improvements? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I’m starting to forget some code so if I just went and revised over it then I’d be doing a lot more but currently I’ve done about 7 or 8 exercises so I think I’m doing fine at the moment.</td>
  </tr>
